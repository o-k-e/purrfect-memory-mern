## About The Project

Welcome to the **Purrfectly Pawsome Memory Game**! 🐾🐱

This project is a fun and interactive memory game built with **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, and **Vite + React**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**, and written entirely in **JavaScript**.  
Players flip adorable kitty cards and try to find matching pairs, aiming to complete the deck with the fewest moves possible.

### Key Highlights:
- 🎴 Randomly fetched cat images from **The Cat API**
- 🔐 User authentication: login, register, and profile management
- 🏆 Live scoreboard to showcase top players
- ✨ Smooth page navigation and simple animations
- 📱 Responsive, mobile-friendly, and playful design
- 🎵 For the best experience, make sure to play with sound enabled! 

The main goal of this project was to learn and practice **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** development, including routing, API calls, and integrating third-party services — all while creating an engaging and delightful user experience.

Good luck, and may the purrs be ever in your favor! 😸

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v21.4.0) – [Download here][Node.js-url]
- **MongoDB Atlas account** – [Sign up here][MongoDB-url]

---

### Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you would like to save the repository.
    ```bash
    https://github.com/o-k-e/purrfect-memory-mern.git
    cd purrfect-memory-mern
    ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Copy the example environment file and rename it to `.env` inside the server directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

   Then open the newly created `.env` file and update the values to match your own credentials:

   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://YOUR_USERNAM:YOUR_DB_PASSWORD@cluster0.vlwvb93.mongodb.net/"
   ```

3. **Running the Project**

    Seed the database by running seed.js:
    ```
    cd server
    node seed.js
    ```

    Start the backend server:
    ````
    cd server
    npm run dev
    ````

    Start the frontend client:
    ````
    cd client
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ````

   These commands will:
    - Populate the MongoDB database with initial seed data.
    - Start the server.
    - Start the Vite React frontend.

    After completing the setup steps:
    
    - 🖥️ Your **frontend** will be available at:  
      🔗 [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (default Vite port)
    
    - 🛠️ Your **backend server** will be running at:  
      🔗 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (default Express port)
      
       
4. **Access the Application**

  Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:5173

5. **Stop the Application**

To stop the application:

- In the **backend** terminal window, press `CTRL + C`.
- In the **frontend (client)** terminal window, press `CTRL + C`.

### Troubleshooting

- Port Conflicts:
  Ensure ports 3000 and 5173 are not in use by other processes.
- MongoDB Connection Issues:
  Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster allows connections from your IP (0.0.0.0/0 for all IPs).  
  Verify that DATABASE_URL in .env is correct.
